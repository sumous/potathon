These basic first steps should have gotten you started with the library.

By now, you should know how to call friendly methods and how to work with
the returned objects, how things work inside event handlers, etc.

Next, we will see a quick reference summary of *all* the methods and
properties that you will need when using the library. If you follow
the links there, you will expand the documentation for the method
and property, with more examples on how to use them.

Therefore, **you can find an example on every method** of the client
to learn how to use it, as well as a description of all the arguments.

After that, we will go in-depth with some other important concepts
that are worth learning and understanding.

From now on, you can keep pressing the "Next" button if you want,
or use the menu on the left, since some pages are quite lengthy.
